First you need to do a scf calculation and get WAVECAR, because in the calculation of PARCHG VASP needs to load a converged WAVECAR. Remember to set ISYM=-1 to turn off the symmetry otherwise VASP will mess up the weights for kpoints in 
the PARCHG calculation.

After you finished scf calculation. You should copy INCAR POSCAR POTCAR KPOINTS WAVECAR to a new folder to prepare the partial charge calculation.

Next, we should add some lines to the end of old INCAR, settings of INCAR depends on what kind of PARCHG you need

1. 
If you just want to specify an energy interval [E1, E2] (with respect to fermi) and expect VASP to calculate the summed charge density for all kpoints and all bands in that energy interval, you should add several lines below:

ISTART=1
LPARD = T 
EINT = -1 1  # set the energy interval, if NBMOD=-2 they are considered as absolute energy values, if NBMOD=-3 they are considered as energy values with respect to fermi
NBMOD = -3

2. 
to be done
