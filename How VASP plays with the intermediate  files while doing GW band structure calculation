To produce a GW band structure (take GW0 method as example) you need to do this with VASP:

1. self consistent calculation then you have WAVECAR.SCF

2. load WAVECAR.SCF and perform exact hamiltonian diagonalization in VASP to obtain the virtual orbitals. Then you have WAVECAR.VIR which includes the information of occupied and virtual orbitals.

3. load WAVECAR.VIR and do GW calculation. Here I set ALGO=GW0 so the orbitals will not be updated during the calculation. Only the eigenvalues will be adjusted.
   Here you should know, any WAVECAR stores information not only about the wavefunction but also about the eigenvalues.
   So if you carefully compare WAVECAR.VIR and WAVECAR.GW, you will find the same wavefunction but different eigenvalues for some orbitals.

4. load WAVECAR.GW and generate wannier90 input files, including 
  wannier90.eig   wannier90.mmn  wannier90.win  wannier90.amn

  The file wannier90.eig stores eigenvalues in GW calculation

  The file wannier90.mmn and wannier90.amn stores the wavefunction overlap matrix and wavefunction projection matrix. 
  These two files are only dependent on wavefunction stored in WAVECAR and it has nothing to do with the eigenvalues stored in WAVECAR.
  So let us imagine you load WAVECAR.VIR or WAVECAR.GW to generate wannier90 input files, you will find exactly the same wannier90.mmn and wannier90.amn but different wannier90.eig for these two WAVECAR files.
